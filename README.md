## Week 2

<ins> Monday </ins>
- Continued with ML crash course.
- Did research on the following models for catching anomalies in data:
    - Support Vector Machine (Hyper Plane Model)
    - Isolation Forest (Tree Model)
    - Autoencoder (Neural Network Model)
- Learnt about **autoencoder** in detail to apply it in anomaly detection in time series. Learnt:
    - Architecture of autoencoder
    - Loss function of autoencoder
    - Types of autoencoder
    - Previewed sample python code for autoencoder

<ins> Tuesday </ins>
- Meeting with Dr. Rohit to discuss non-linear regression models to analyze power quality data:
    - Touched up on autencoders and how they can help in our case of anomaly detection.
    - Discussed starter project for analysing anomalies in time series.
    - Assigned work for developing standard python templates for:
        - Data statistics
        - Autoencoder
        - Decision tree

<ins> Wednesday </ins>
- Visited the **Oragadam Factory** with:
    - **Mr. Sahil Bundela**, <sabne@vestas.com>, Data Engineer in Plant Monitoring & Reliability
    - **Dr. Monojit Das**, <moida@vestas.com>, Assistant Lead Engineer in Plant Monitoring & Reliability
    - **Mr. Ganesh Sukumar**, <gasku@vestas.com>, Data Scientist in Plant Monitoring & Reliability
- Took a tour of the plant, led by **Mr. Manikandan Eswaran**, <mkdes@vestas.com>, Sr. PEX & Project Engineer in Oragadam Nacelles.
- Explored:
    - Training room: used to familiarize new employees with the equipment.
    - VSM (Value Stream Mapping) room.
    - DMM (Daily Management Meeting) board: learnt about their organisation and division of tasks.
    - Drive Train and Assembly Line.
- Learnt about:
    - The scale of the factory.
    - Production and transportation costs.
    - Yearly capacity for production.
    - Supply chain of materials.
    - Practicalities of the 2 MW and 4 MW turbines.
    - Manufacturing and testing process and their time period.
- After coming back, began looking for a base for Autoencoder:
    - Browsed GitHub repositories and GeeksforGeeks for sample code.
    - Looked at other ML models that could be applied to the problem.

<ins> Thursday </ins>
- Started working on Autoencoder to predict output of given data (excel sheet):
    - Adapted sample code to Python 3.13.5 (sample code not supported by Python 3.13.5).
    - Coded a basic autoencoer with 4 inputs and 1 output and trained it on randomly generated data.
    - Employed the basic autoencoder to train it on the excel sheet of data.
- Participated in company fire drill.
